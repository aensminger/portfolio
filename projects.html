						I've worked with a handful of companies to help launch their IoT
						application. This generally means working through device communication,
						data modeling and management, UI/UX design, testing, and deployment.
						In addition, this often includes developing the documentation for the
						product, as well as managing subsequent sandbox development and future software
						releases.

						While the product I work on is entirely IoT cloud software, there is no IoT without
						'Things.' From various demos, to hardware-partner integrations, to end
						customer support/development, there has been a host of reasons for me
						to hook up some tangible device here in my office. Most notably, I wrote
            a cloud integration plugin for a global leader in remote sensing hardware.
            That plugin currenly ships with their flagship edge gateway product. Other
            work ranges from full integrations to POC and exploratory projects.

        When I started here, we had no real automated testing framework or code
        quality metrics, for plenty of good reasons. After we migrated the
        application to Java, it became more reasonable to develop an automated
        test package alongside the actual product code.

        <br/>
        I led the research, design and
        implementation of these essential software development tools. As these
        toolsets are naturally ever-evolving, I have lots of plans for their
        improvement and expansion as well.

          One of the most powerful ways to improve functionality in a web application is to
          integrate with some other web accessible system. I've worked on several
          of these types of projects - incorporating live weather data into an IoT
          dashboard, integrating enterprise PLM, CRM and remote connectivity platforms,
          and pulling remote sensing data from multiple third-party cloud systems
          to display in a single consolidated environment.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Often the biggest challenge of these types of projects is not the technology
          required to connect the systems effectively and securely, but the disparate
          business contexts of each party involved. This means assessing each
          application's core strengths and limitations to identify the most important
          points of integration, while developing a unified system for translating between
          data, process and usage models that are not exactly aligned.

          Assembling and deploying this portoflio site has been a good opportunity
          to improve some lesser-used skillsets. I tried to work with the simplest
          HTML/CSS/JS as possible, no frameworks necessary here. I did a bit of my
          own take on the content delivery system, but its nothing radical....
