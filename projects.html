						I've worked with a handful of companies to help launch their IoT
						application. This generally means working through device communication,
						data modeling and management, UI/UX design, testing, and deployment.
						In addition, this often includes developing the documentation for the
						product, as well as managing subsequent sandbox development and future software
						releases.

            The product I work on is an IoT Cloud SaaS, and my work ranges from
            sales demos, to partner integrations
            (hardware, and embedded software, and enterprise software), to full
            design and development on behalf of our customers. But there is no
            IoT without 'Things', and while some of my work is in the cloud,
            there have been a host of reasons for me to hook up some tangible
            devices from customers and partners here in my office. Most notably, I wrote a Java based
            cloud integration plugin for a global leader in remote sensing
            hardware, which essentially took local sensor data and safely moved
            it to the cloud, allowing new customers to jump start their IoT
            application development. That plugin currenly ships with their
            flagship edge gateway product. Other work ranges from full
            integrations to POC and exploratory projects.

        There are many reasons (business, technical or otherwise) for early software
        products to not have an automated testing framework or code quality metrics.
        A recent language migration of our core application presented the opportunity
        to improve our QA infrastructure as well.

        <br/>
        I led the research, design and
        implementation of these essential software development tools. As these
        toolsets are naturally ever-evolving, I have lots of plans for their
        improvement and expansion as well.

          One of the most powerful ways to improve functionality in a web application is to
          integrate with some other web accessible system. I've worked on several
          of these types of projects - incorporating live weather data into an IoT
          dashboard, integrating enterprise PLM, CRM and remote connectivity platforms,
          and pulling remote sensing data from multiple third-party cloud systems
          to display in a single consolidated environment.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Often the biggest challenge of these types of projects is not the technology
          required to connect the systems effectively and securely, but the disparate
          business contexts of each party involved. This means assessing each
          application's core strengths and limitations to identify the most important
          points of integration, while developing a unified system for translating between
          data, process and usage models that are not exactly aligned.

          Assembling and deploying this portoflio site has been a good opportunity
          to improve some lesser-used skillsets. I tried to work with the simplest
          HTML/CSS/JS as possible, so this is just built from scratch, hosted on my own AWS S3 instance. I did a bit of my
          own take on the html loading system, but its nothing radical....
